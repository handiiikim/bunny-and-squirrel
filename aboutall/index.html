    <p> Naver is a Korean search engine which is called as 'Korean Google'. </br>
      Almost every Korean use this engine. Because of this, The government and huge companies
      started to manipulate this engine for their own sakes. For covering what they've done wrong,
      They replace the authentic trends and headlines to very absurd and unbelievable topics. Against this,
      Quite many Korean started to use SNS for sharing what the authority tries to hide. Especially,
      within 4 years, a lot of political and economical issues happened in Korea, but barely could check those news in main domain of Naver.
      Then, How about Twitter? Scraping main trends in both sites on specific 9 dates, I visualise the comparison of the information.

In 2014, former CEO Bang told me, ‘There was a girl I met and contacted often for awhile in 2008 or 2009 and she committed suicide. I asked someone I know and (the case) was covered up.’ I later found out from former CEO Bang that the girl was Ms. Jang Ja Yeon.

Naver never posted news about “Jeong Kyung-sim” who is a professor in Korea and wife of former South Korean Justice Minister Cho Kuk. She got arrested in corruption scandal.

Naver kept on posting news strengthening on this opposite party’’s side.
