    <p> Naver is a Korean search engine which is called as 'Korean Google'. </br>
      Almost every Korean use this engine. Because of this, The government and huge companies
      started to manipulate this engine for their own sakes. For covering what they've done wrong,
      They replace the authentic trends and headlines to very absurd and unbelievable topics. Against this,
      Quite many Korean started to use SNS for sharing what the authority tries to hide. Especially,
      within 4 years, a lot of political and economical issues happened in Korea, but barely could check those news in main domain of Naver.
      Then, How about Twitter? Scraping main trends in both sites on specific 9 dates, I visualise the comparison of the information.
